## FLAW 1

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

#### Description

According to OWASP, XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victimâ€™s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.


The HttpOnly flag directs compatible browsers to prevent client-side script from accessing cookies. Including the HttpOnly flag in the Set-Cookie HTTP response header helps mitigate the risk associated with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) where an attacker's script code might attempt to read the contents of a cookie and exfiltrate information obtained. When set, browsers that support the flag will not reveal the contents of the cookie to a third party via client-side script executed via XSS. 


#### Where the flaw is and how to fix it

CyberSecurityBaseProjectApplication-class has customize-method with the line **cntxt.setUseHttpOnly(false);**

Remove that or set *false* to *true* so HttpOnly -cookie will be used.
